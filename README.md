# Mage is my personal fork of LEM, the best program ever !

personal project, not fit for mass use

## check out LEM's official page
[Official LEM Repo](https://github.com/lem-project/lem)

### reasons for my fork

i like how the sdl2 version looks and works on my machine.  'twould be cool to port the sdl2 frontend to sdl3, but right now i just want to experiment with other features and have some stability.  LEM's development is moving a little too fast for me right now, and i want more stability.

i want to add some new modifiers like Lux, Pico, and Nano.  and i want to try my hand at changing some things
