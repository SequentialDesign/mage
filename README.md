# Mage is a personal fork of LEM

LEM is the best program ever.  Mage is a personal project, not fit for mass use.  it is not an official fork or in any way associated with the LEM project.  i'm simply a fan

## reasons for my fork

i like how the sdl2 version looks and works on my machine.  'twould be cool to port the sdl2 frontend to sdl3, but right now i just want to experiment with other features and have some more stability.  i want the ability to make more extreme changes to it

checklist for future plans
- [ ] add more modifiers (have every side mod (Left Shift, Right Alt, Left Control, Right GUI, etc. be its own mod).  something like Lux, Pico, and Nano
- [ ] make Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock be mods
- [ ] provide options for shortening text in menus
- [ ] extend and clean up theming options
- [ ] incorporate more third-party libraries
- [ ] get rid of Vim stuff and add a much more flexible modal option (very low priority as i like LEM's original keybinds)
- [ ] clean up keybinds and create a standard for them
- [ ] add way more commands
- [ ] add more packages (like a text expansion package)
- [ ] tweak some search stuff (which is amazing in LEM)
- [ ] learn more about LEM.  this is really just something fun for me
- [ ] change some command names to better reflect what they do
- [ ] make prompts "smarter", making them start where the user can input text
